# Healthcare Analytics Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project analyzes patient healthcare data to identify patterns in risk levels, age distribution, and medical conditions.
Python was used for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis, and Power BI was used to create an interactive dashboard.
